<H1>SMALL IMAGE CLASSIFIER</H1>
The small image classifier using Python is a machine learning project designed to classify images into predefined categories. Utilizing libraries  TensorFlow and PyTorch, it involves preprocessing the data, building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and training it on a dataset. The model is then evaluated using a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy. With the trained model, users can input new images for classification, providing insights into the objects or scenes depicted. This project serves as a fundamental introduction to image classification techniques and can be expanded upon for more complex tasks.
